; ## Intersections
;
; A ray aways interesects a sphere at 2 points, even when tangent, or it totally misses the sphere.
; - when a ray is tangent to a sphere, both distances are equals.
; - when the ray originates inside a sphere, one of the distance is negative.
; - when the sphere is behing the ray's origin, both distances are negatives.

; The first intersection distance is always the smallest.

; ## Normal

; Normal is easy to calculate since the sphere is always centered at the origin.

; ## Creation

; Spheres are record implementing Shape protocol.
